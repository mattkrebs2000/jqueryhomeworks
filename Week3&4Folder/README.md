Week 1 Instructions:

Watch the videos listed above and look over the example (js and html files).

Your goal will be to reproduce the html from website.html but do it through a js file. This means that your html file should only have body tags or a single div tag into which you will dynamically input the rest of the html code. 

Please pay close attention to the following requirements: 

1. You may not use the "innerhtml" property as you can see how easy that would be in "website.js."

2. You must use a forloop of a for each loop to render the menu items (home, about, portfolio etc.)

3. Your website should look exactly like the original version from website.html. 

4. write in atleast 4 comments describing what you are doing. 

5. (For full credit) - you should try to delay the rendering of these menu items so that they appear one after the other.

 
Save your work (should be a folder with images folder, js file, html file and css file)to a repository of your own and pass in a link to it when you are done.
